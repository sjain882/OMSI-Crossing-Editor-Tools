    2b. Set the bullet point option to "Disabled" and click "Save".

    2c. Does it create HELEN.exe.bak in the same folder? [Expected: Yes] Does the message box that appears reflect this? [Expected: Yes]

    2d. In the version info box, does the checksum change [Expected: Yes] and the "Yes" change to "No"? [Expected: Yes]

3. Repeat steps 2a-2c for all other versions.
